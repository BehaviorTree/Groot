# DEPRECATION notice

Groot is being rewritten from the ground up (https://www.behaviortree.dev/groot). 
This repository will be in "maintenance mode" and won't receive any significant update. 
Issues will **not** be addressed by the main author but, occasionally, Pull Requests **might** be checked and merged.

**Groot 1.0 is compatible only with BehaviorTree.CPP 3.8.x**, and it is not expected to 
work correctly with BehaviorTree.CPP 4.x.

Groot 2.0 introduces many new functionalities and compatibility with BT.CPP 4.0.

**If you use Groot at work** and you want to know how we are redesigning it to be more flexible, 
reliable, fast and scalable, get in touch with the main author: dfaconti@aurynrobotics.com.

# Groot 

**Groot** is a Graphical Editor, written in C++ and Qt, to create [BehaviorTrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree).

It is compliant with the the library [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP).

In the following video you can see how the C++ library and
the graphic user interface are used to design and monitor a Behavior Tree.

# Dependencies, Installation, and Usage

To compile the project you need:

- [CMake 3.2](https://cmake.org/download)
- Qt5 (tested with version 5.5.1), including the SVG module.

On Ubuntu Xenial or later, you can install the dependencies with:

       sudo apt install qtbase5-dev libqt5svg5-dev libzmq3-dev libdw-dev
      
Some functionalities of the code related to ROS will work __only__ if the
project is compiled with _catkin_.

## Compilation instructions (Linux)

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot.git
cd Groot
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```
       
 Note compiling "in-source" is not allowed.   
 
 ## Compilation instructions (ROS/ROS2)

**Discouraged**

If you want to compile using `catkin build`(ROS) or `colcon_build` (ROS2)
then you must be sure that version 3.8.x is used (branch V3.8).

You may probably want to compile BehaviorTree.CPP in the same workspace.

```
git clone --branch v3.8 https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP.git
```
