# Groot 

**Groot** is a Graphical Editor, written in C++ and Qt, to create [BehaviorTrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree).

It is compliant with the the library [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP).

In the following video you can see how the C++ library and
the graphic user interface are used to design and monitor a Behavior Tree.

# Dependencies, Installation, and Usage

To compile the project you need:

- [CMake 3.2](https://cmake.org/download)
- Qt5 (tested with version 5.5.1), including the SVG module.

On Ubuntu Xenial or later, you can install the dependencies with:

       sudo apt install qtbase5-dev libqt5svg5-dev libzmq3-dev libdw-dev
      
Some functionalities of the code related to ROS will work __only__ if the
project is compiled with with _catkin_.

# Compilation instructions (Linux)

       git clone https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot.git
       cd Groot
       git submodule update --init --recursive
       mkdir build; cd build
       cmake ..
       make
       
 Note compiling "in-source" is not allowed.   
 
 # Compilation instructions (ROS)

       mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
       cd catkin_ws/src
       git clone https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot.git
       cd ..
       rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src
       catkin_make
